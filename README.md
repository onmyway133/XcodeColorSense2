## Story

**What is that hex color? ü§î**

All my apps use hex color now. But when browsing the source code, it's hard to know which color it is, I normally need an app or go to Chrome to checkout the color, I want to do that within Xcode

That's why I made [XcodeColorSense](https://github.com/onmyway133/XcodeColorSense), which shows us the color for a particular hex or rgb color. But from Xcode 8+ it is not possible to have Xcode plugin.

So this is my 2nd attempt to make that available in Xcode, through Xcode Source Editor Extension. I used [Farge](https://github.com/onmyway133/Farge) to find name of a hex color

I want to use framework in the extension, but Xcode keeps complaining about that http://stackoverflow.com/questions/43673353/how-to-use-framework-in-xcode-source-editor-extension

I use [GifCapture](https://github.com/onmyway133/GifCapture) to capture the gif. Here I use key binding <kbd>Cmd+Ctrl+S</kbd> to toggle color info

## How to install

- Use the built binary https://github.com/onmyway133/XcodeColorSense2/releases

## How to use
